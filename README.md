# Employee List

## Problem Statement
--------
An employee manager wants to keep track of her employees and their details, but she is tired of writing everything on pen and paper, as it takes longer to review and edit.
The Employee App stores all employees and their respective data in a list. Furthermore, the user can easily review, edit, or delete entries.
